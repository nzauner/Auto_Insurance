## Project Goals:

- Analyze auto insurance data.
- Build a logistic regression model to predict crash probability for auto insurance customers.
- Build a linear regression model to predict crash cost for auto insurance customers.
- Use model results to develop crash percentage and assign customers to new risk profiles.
- Determine cost of premiums based on risk profiles.

## Summary of Data:

The dataset for this project contains 6044 records of auto insurance data. Each record
represents a customer at an auto insurance company. Using this data, we will be able to ascertain what
influences the likelihood of a car crash. Then subsequently, we will be able to determine the cost to resolve a claim. The data in this project is the typical type of corporate data you would receive from a company in the insurance field-- a typical flat file from client records.
